Alia is a self-optimising & self-repairing Pyborg IRC Bot.

The original Pyborg was written by Tom Morton and Sébastien Dailly. It's a simple python Markov chain driven bot (similar to MegaHAL) with the unique ability to learn speech patterns by figure out which words go togeher well. This gives it the ability to generate replies on it's own aswell as repeating previously learned responses.

What sets Alia apart from the default pyborg bot is the following:
* Alia has bash scripts to start her quietly and keep small logs which only report when bugs happen.
* Alia self-optimises and self-repairs - if a bug occurs, Alia will attempt to correct it herself without human intervention. She will also optimise and save her dictionary/word list every 2 hours and rebuild it every day to keep it error free.
* Alia strips common error causing input (like urls and strange characters) by default to avoid dictionary corruption.
* Alia doesn't mangle emoticons (smileys) or punctuation. She also correct I and I contractions and capitalizes the first letter of every sentence.
* Alia logs all private conversation (except with masters) in a physical form (example: http://user.gigirc.com/~brenton/logs/)
* Alia can be talked to with IM clients using bitlbee and pyborg-im.py! (Example: http://www.facebook.com/alia.smart)
And many more! (See ChangeLog for complete list)

To use Alia, just run python pyborg-irc.py to generate the cfg files. Press Ctrl+C to stop pyborg-irc.py.
Modify pyborg-irc.cfg and pyborg.cfg to suit your neeeds and then use ./alia to start the bot silently.
Now allow her to idle in a busy channel so she can learn some basic responses. That's it, your done. Enjoy!
